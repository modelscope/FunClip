# ParaClipper

## What's New

- 2024/02/28 Update call function of funasr into funasr1.0, use SeACo_Paraformer thus ASR now supports hotword. Also support destination transcription like 'abcd[-100,150]#efgh[200,200]' to adjust offset time for every sub-sentence (TODO: use ParaClipper with command line is not updated currently).
- 2023/10/17 Bug fix for multiple periods chosen, used to return video with wrong length.
- 2023/10/10 ParaClipper now supports recognizing with speaker diarization ability, choose 'yes' button in 'Recognize Speakers' and you will get recognition results with speaker id for each sentence. And then you can clip out the periods of one or some speakers (e.g. 'spk0' or 'spk0#spk3') using ParaClipper.

## Use ParaClipper to Clip Your Video

ParaClipper</strong> enables users to clip ```.mp4``` video files or ```.wav``` audio files with chosen text segments out of the recognition results generated by [Paraformer-long model](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_paraformer-large-vad-punc_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch/summary).

Under the help of ParaClipper you can get the video clips easily with the following steps (in Gradio service):
- Step1: Upload your video file (or try the example videos below)
- Step2: Copy the text segments you need to 'Text to Clip'
- Step3: Adjust subtitle settings (if needed)
- Step4: Click 'Clip' or 'Clip and Generate Subtitles'

### Usage
```shell
# install funasr (necessary)
pip install -U funasr
# install python dependency
pip install -r ParaClipper/requirments.txt
```
(Optional) If you want to clip video file with embedded subtitles

1. ffmpeg and imagemagick is required

- On Ubuntu
```shell
apt-get -y update && apt-get -y install ffmpeg imagemagick
sed -i 's/none/read,write/g' /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
```
- On MacOS
```shell
brew install imagemagick
sed -i 's/none/read,write/g' /usr/local/Cellar/imagemagick/7.1.1-8_1/etc/ImageMagick-7/policy.xml 
```
2. Download font file to ParaClipper/font

```shell
wget https://isv-data.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ics/MaaS/ParaClipper/STHeitiMedium.ttc -O ParaClipper/font/STHeitiMedium.ttc
```

#### Experience ParaClipper in Modelscope
You can try ParaClipper in modelscope space: [link](https://modelscope.cn/studios/damo/funasr_app_ParaClipper/summary).

#### Use ParaClipper as Gradio Service
You can establish your own ParaClipper service which is same as [Modelscope Space](https://modelscope.cn/studios/damo/funasr_app_ParaClipper/summary) as follow:
```shell
python ParaClipper/gradio_service.py
```
then visit ```localhost:7860``` you will get a Gradio service like below and you can use ParaClipper following the steps:

#### Use ParaClipper in command line
ParaClipper supports you to recognize and clip with commands:
```shell
# working in ParaClipper/
# step1: Recognize
python ParaClipper/videoclipper.py --stage 1 \
                       --file examples/2022云栖大会_片段.mp4 \
                       --output_dir ./output
# now you can find recognition results and entire SRT file in ./output/
# step2: Clip
python ParaClipper/videoclipper.py --stage 2 \
                       --file examples/2022云栖大会_片段.mp4 \
                       --output_dir ./output \
                       --dest_text '我们把它跟乡村振兴去结合起来，利用我们的设计的能力' \
                       --start_ost 0 \
                       --end_ost 100 \
                       --output_file './output/res.mp4'
```

### Study Speech Related Models in FunASR

[FunASR](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunASR) hopes to build a bridge between academic research and industrial applications on speech recognition. By supporting the training & finetuning of the industrial-grade speech recognition model released on ModelScope, researchers and developers can conduct research and production of speech recognition models more conveniently, and promote the development of speech recognition ecology.
